### Hi there 👋

I'm a Full Stack Web and Mobile App Developer. I am currently working at Bristlecone as an Intern on Data Migration, Electron and Flask applications. I really enjoy making clean and interactive UI which is easy to use. I have experience working with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work on something new.

Some of my key skills include - Flutter, React Native, React, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, Python and C++
