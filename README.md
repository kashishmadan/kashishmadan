## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. In the summer of 2023, I worked at LinkedIn as a software engineering intern on the LinkedIn Sales Navigator tool. Prior to starting my graduate degree, I worked at Microsoft as an Application Developer in their Azure Cloud and AI team.

My top skills are C++, Java, Python, React, Swift, Flutter, C#, .NET, Node.js, Operating Systems, Linux/UNIX, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Artificial Intellgence.

Outside of my usual work schedule, I am building @instaiform to help you create simple forms using AI :)
