### Hi there
[![Kashish's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=kashishmadan&show_icons=true&theme=radical)]()

I am currently working at American Express as an Intern in the Big Data Technology Unit. I also have experience working at Bristlecone as an Intern on Data Migration, Electron and Flask applications. I really enjoy making clean and interactive UI which is easy to use. I have experience working with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work on something new.

Some of my key skills include - Flutter, React and React Native, Electron, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, Python and C++
